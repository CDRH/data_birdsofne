         <p>This interesting little Plover arrives here to breed about the first of May, but does not commence housekeeping until the middle part of the same month.</p>
         
         <p>I have found a set of two eggs the 13th of May which I presume is about as early as they commence laying in this locality.</p>
         
         <p>Their favorite nesting site seems to be the barren sandbars in the rivers, although I have found a nest of this species on a sandbar which had quite a growth of young willows.</p>
         
         <p>They scratch several shallow holes in the sand and seem to take possession of the dryest one.</p>
         
         <p>In a dry season they very seldom line their nest but in a wet season they will occasionally line it with pebbles and bits of tried twigs.</p>
         
         <p>I have found them to lay two and three sets in a season, but seldom three except when their nests have been robbed. I have never found the birds setting on their nests, but which I presume they do during the night.</p>
