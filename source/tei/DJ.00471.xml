         <head>The Junco.</head>
         
         <p>Wherever you may roam along the roadsides in the winter, the colder the better, you are pretty sure to hear the wiry twang of the call of the Slate-colored Junco, and to see the flash of his white tail feathers as he dives from one patch of underbrush to another.</p>
         
         <p>Generally Mr. Junco is not alone, but grouped with a large number of his pals, liberally sprinkled with Tree Sparrows.</p>
         
         <p>The Junco, as his full name would suggest is a darby. He eats weed seeds until his little tummy is almost popping, and has positively no bad habits, as far as ornithologists have ascertained to date.</p>
         
         <p>In the zero periods of our winters the Junco is the most active, and a study of this bird is well worth while. He is one of the busiest of the winter tribe, and many folk call him a "Snowbird," which is a misnomer inasmuch as many other birds seem to have secured the same title.</p>
         
         <p>The Junco, in the spring, has a very beautiful little song, which he saves for that occasion, but in winter, as has been remarked, his wiry twang or a sharp chip are all that he can do to help you in his identification.</p>
         
         <p>A grand little bird, this Slate Colored Junco, and well worth becoming acquainted with.</p>
         
         <p>Try that acquaintanceship today.</p>
