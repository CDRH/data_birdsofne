            <hi rend="bold">Nebraska</hi> - Tecumseh, Sept, 28.- In regard to the chicken shooting, we have not had very good success this season. The farmers burned the grass to a great extent in this section early this spring. This, in connection with the dry weather, has had a bad effect. We have reports from the vicinity of Lincoln, Nebraska, forty-eight miles north, that chickens can be found in great numbers, but we have no personal knowledge of the fact. The quail shooting here is excellent, and we could guarantee some good sport. We are too far north for ducks and geese. E.R.Barnes.</p>
