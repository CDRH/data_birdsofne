         <p>Old Squaw Duck (<hi rend="italic">Clangula hyemalis</hi>). Two specimens of this bird were killed on Cut-off Lake near this city December 8, 1900, by a local sportsman. He had never seen this species before, brought the heads to me to identify, and I have them now in my possession.</p>
         
         <p>White-Winged Scoter (<hi rend="italic">Oidenmia deglandi</hi>). I have one of these ducks which was killed on Cut-off Lake, December 8, 1900.</p>
         
         <p>Tufted Titmouse (<hi rend="italic">Parus bicolor</hi>). One was killed by L.F. Skow near Florence, October 5, 1900.</p>
         
         <p>Evening Grosbeak (<hi rend="italic">Coccothraustes vespertinus</hi>). A specimen was killed by L. Skow near Florence, October 12, 1900. The heads and wings of two were also brought by a local sportsman (?) to R. F. Mullen during the first week of November, 1900.</p>
         
         <p>Blue-Gray Gnatcatcher (<hi rend="italic">Polioptila caerulea</hi>). Two nests containing three and four eggs respectively were found near Bellevue in June, 1900. F.H. Shoemaker and I.S. Trostler photographed one of these after the young were hatched.</p>
         
         <p>Yellow-throated Vireo (<hi rend="italic">Vireo flavifrons</hi>). R.F. Mullen found a nest and four eggs of this species near Bellevue in June, 1900.</p>
         
         <p>Cerulean Warbler (<hi rend="italic">Dendrodoa caerulea</hi>). I found three nests of this species in 1900 near Bellevue. One contained four badly incubated eggs, the second a young bird, the third three slightly incubated eggs.</p>
