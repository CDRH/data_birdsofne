         <head>Feathered Picnickers.</head>
         
         <p>Around every picnic ground in every park there will be found, with the usual exception that is noted in all pets, a couple of the most suave and obliging birds of picnic prey in the business - the Bronzed Grackle and the Blue Jay.</p>
         
         <p>These birds are large and powerful, as well as having appetites commensurate with their size. They have the brains of a burglar and would much rather secure their food for nothing than pay for it with hard work. SO they follow the camps of the picnickers.</p>
         
         <p>It is no uncommon sight in our larger and more popular parks to see whole flocks of Grackles stalking or fluttering somewhat sedately about the premises waiting for a chance to clean up after the merrymakers. The Blue Jays, while not so numerous, are equally crafty and equally eager.</p>
         
         <p>A Grackle can fly away with a ham sandwich as easily as you would carry it in your pocket, while the Jays are just as strong but a little more inclined to nefarious theft. They will sneak up on the victuals when nobody is looking and attempt to massacre a bunch of fried chicken already deceased.</p>
         
         <p>In any park it is a common sight to see a Bronzed Grackle, sometimes known as the Crown Blackbird, flying away with what would seem to be at least half a loaf of bread, with which to feed its young.</p>
         
         <p>During the winter the Blue Jay hangs around places where food is spread, such as the menagerie in Riverview park, but the Grackle takes no chances and goes south.</p>
         
         <p>No picnic is complete without these camp-followers. They are useful birds, since they are out-door house-cleaners. The Grackle has no bad habits, but the Jays occasionally tear up other birds' nests and eat their eggs.</p>
