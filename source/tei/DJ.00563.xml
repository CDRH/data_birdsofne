         <head>Much Game in Nebraska.</head>
         
         <p>Exeter, Neb., Oct. 16.—All the birds with the exception of the robin, and a few meadow larks and snipe have left this section. Bob White was never more plentiful; every hedge, thicket, or any place offering the least shelter has its covey, riding in the country one can hear the little fellows calling on every side.</p>
         
         <p>Yesterday a flock of sixteen flew into my corral and stayed quite a while round the straw stacks. Ducks and geese have not shown up so far, although they would not probably stop on account of the water holes being nearly dry.</p>
         
         <p>One can get a jack rabbit by just walking across the fields, while the little cotton-tail can be shot from one's doorstep. Chickens are also quite numerous, more so than for years past. Five wolves were seen about two miles south of here yesterday.</p>
