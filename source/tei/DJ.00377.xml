         <head>The Grand Fall Hunt.</head>
         
         <p>The grand fall hunt of the Omaha Gun club came off Thursday, and so far as the hunting was concerned, it was a colossal success. In fact the emulous Nimrods found the hunting good everywhere, but the game scarce. The count on either side on this momentous occasion is not more than one-third that of last year, and there are many disappointed gunners in the city. As has been repeatedly stated the object of this great annual inroad on the furred and feathered game is a grand banquet, which is to be given at the Millard this evening, the losing side defraying the expenses thereof. One of the most conspicuous features of the present hunt is that the amateurs fairly wiped up the earth with the professionals, i.e., the tyros with the gun beat the old experienced hunters out of sight as the following record, giving the game killed and count agreed on, clearly proves:</p>
