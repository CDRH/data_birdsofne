         <p>When put up against a convulsion of nature such as visited Omaha and vicinity a week ago in the form of torrential rains that flooded everything, until the creeks climbed out of their virtuous beds and meandered all over the place, the nesting ground-birds suffer considerably.</p>
         
         <p>Such songsters as the Field Sparrow, the Horned Lark, the Meadowlark, the Yellowthroat and the Night Hawk, that nest on or near the ground, are subjected to real tragedy in such instances.</p>
         
         <p>it is probable that thousands and thousands of nests in the vicinity of Omaha were swept away by the floods and high waters of a week ago. This is very pitiful, for it has been proven time and again how thoroughly the parent birds adore their offspring, as well as their nests and eggs.</p>
         
         <p>But it is equally interesting to see how busily these abused creatures take up the work of rehabilitation.</p>
         
         <p>The Field Sparrow, for instance, after high water of the sort described, invariably builds its second nest much higher - generally in some little shrub growing up from a clump of grass. Nature teaches birds these lessons, and they do not forget.</p>
         
         <p>As for the Horned Larks, they have mostly completed their propagation for the year. And the Night Hawks, well, they will have to come down to some gravel roof to be absolutely safe.</p>
         
         <p>The birds certainly have their housing troubles, even as do the humans.</p>
