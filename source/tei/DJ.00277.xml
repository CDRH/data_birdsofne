Mr. Kimball was over in Iowa, where he has gone on a pleasure trip, and it was arranged that he should hunt on Wednesday and send his game here by express, but it did not come in time, and Mr. Kimball was reported as not out.</p>

         <head>An Eagle Shot.</head>
         
         <p>Mr. Yankee Hathaway was so fortunate as to kill a Golden Eagle, near Calhoun lake, which measured seven feet and two inches from tip to tip. It was the most noticeable item of game that was brought in by any of the sportsmen.</p>
         
         <p>Two dusky ducks that were in the game pile attracted general attention on account of their rarity.</p>
