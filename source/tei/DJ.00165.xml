         <head>The Chickadee.</head>
         
         <p>More than occasionally we have mentioned the Chickadee - and always favorably. Too much publicity cannot be given this bird, as it is one of the most useful and at the same time one of the most lovable and cheerful and companionable of all of the feathered friends that make themselves acquainted with all who patronize the parks and woods of this vicinity.</p>
         
         <p>Writers have likened the flight of the Chickadee in a snowstorm to a Japanese print - as the little fellow of black, gray and white outlines himself against the storm just as our Nipponese friends might show him in their inimitable decorative water color.</p>
         
         <p>But the Chickadee is more than a painting. He is a a rip-snorting little bundle of nerves and aggressiveness and companionship. He is not afraid of humans, and often will perch on the hats of those who are placing suet-food for him in the glades.</p>
         
         <p>He will sing his summer song in the winter when the sun shines, and even in the worst blizzard will be heard merrily chippering about - hustling food to keep his tiny body together.</p>
         
         <p>The Chickadee eats nothing but insects and seeds and meat fat - and therefore is a wholly useful creation of the Almighty. His personal beauty and friendliness are additional assets. He is a wonderful pal on a hike, and you should cultivate him today.</p>
