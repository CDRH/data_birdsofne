         <head>Cherink! Cherink!</head>
         
         <p>To those of us who delight in tramping the woodland and the tangled ravines in both winter and summer, the first remarks of the retiring Towhee come as a springtime kiss - a sort of salute by Mother Nature, who is good to her own!</p>
         
         <p>He has many songs and carols, which develop as his amorous ardor increases, but he announces his return to the thickets which we prowl, with the single ejaculation - </p>
         
         <p>"Cherink!"</p>
         
         <p>This clinking, grating, undescribable observation on the part of Brer Towhee is a masterpiece of God's outdoor handiwork. It comes to us who "hike" as a remark from heaven itself.</p>
         
         <p>It has none of the louder and more apparent choral beauties of the efforts of the Robin and the Bluebird - nor of the chattering year-around insistency of the Chickadee - but it chinks to us from forbidden messes of weeds and bushes, to say that spring has really arrived, and that somewhere, in a ground-nest hidden beneath some fallen twig of leaf-cluster - there is to be a large family of "Ground-Robins" born.</p>
         
         <p>Presently these Towhees will cease their "Cherink" and will perch on a branch above that mysterious hard-to-find nest, and warble "See-Towhee!" with exasperating loveliness - while the lowly, sneaking Cowbird seeks the Chewink nest that humans seldom strike.</p>
         
         <p>Blessed is this bird indeed! Beautiful, songful and mysterious. Protect it.</p>
         
         <p>"Cherink!"</p>
