         <head>Jenny.</head>
         
         <p>Although we have spoken of her before, Jenny Wren deserves an additional tribute.</p>
         
         <p>There are mornings when the war news isn't quite as good as we would like to have it - but Jenny, with her indomitable spunk, furnishes instant cheer and a splendid example.</p>
         
         <p>Nothing feazes the House Wren - which is Jenny's real name.</p>
         
         <p>Storms, physical combat, personal grief, anxiety of any sort has positively no effect on her good nature, nor on her vocal efforts.</p>
         
         <p>As far as belligerency is concerned, she reminds one a good deal of Belgium. She will fly into the enemy English Sparrows with a fearlessness and fervor that can't help but call forth the plaudits of the multitude - and she wins most of such battles, too. Woe betide the "winged rat" that perches in front of Jenny's house, like a miniature dog-in-the-manger! Mrs. Wren makes short work of him.</p>
         
         <p>But her song - that incessant, delicious bubble of encouragement, for all the world like the rippling of a fresh, cool brook - that is what endears the House Wren to everyone!</p>
         
         <p>Ever on the alert in the capture of insects and worms which might wreck the war garden, Jenny mixes work and pleasure, and has a song for every chapter in her daily life.</p>
         
         <p>We could take an excellent lesson from Jenny House Wren - especially during these parlous times!</p>
