         <head>A Very Sensible Bird.</head>
         
         <p>If you don't mind ruthless frightfulness on the part of the Missouri Valley mosquito squadron now infesting our most delightful wooded spots, you might try a jaunt through the Fontenelle Reserve or the forests north of Florence today, and make yourself acquainted with a very sensible bird.</p>
         
         <p>He is the Golden Crowned Thrush, better known as the Ovenbird, and has a well earned reputation as being a favorite often heard but seldom seen. The man who sees an Ovenbird is likely to have a reputation among amateur ornithologists such as is borne by the sea-faring party who is constantly sighting sea-serpents.</p>
         
         <p>For the Ovenbird is of a modest and retiring disposition - very. He attends to his affairs in the deepest clumps of undergrowth in dark ravines, as a general thing, and doesn't mix very much with his more demonstrative neighbors.</p>
         
         <p>His name is secured from the shape of his nest, which is built of grasses on the ground, a fair imitation of a miniature oven. During this season the shape of this nest isn't the only way in which it resembles an oven, either. Admiral Peary wouldn't feel a bit at home in those deep-cut ravines, where no cooling breeze can filter.</p>
         
         <p>But the Ovenbird shows his wisdom by constantly seeking knowledge. His cry is "Teacher! Teacher! Teacher!" with the accent on the last syllable. It is a call never mistaken after once heard.</p>
         
         <p>Fontenelle Reserve is well populated with Ovenbirds. They will be glad to see you, albeit you will be lucky if you succeed in seeing them.</p>
