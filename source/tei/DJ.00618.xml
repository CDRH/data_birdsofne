         <head>Notes From Nebraska.</head>
         
         <head>From J.R. Bonwell, Nebraska City, Neb.</head>
         
         <p>Large flocks of Robins and Meadow larks are in this vicinity, now probably on their way south.</p>
         
         <p>No doubt a great many species have already gone, as one misses a great many once familiar voices now in the wood.</p>
         
         <p>A number of observers have mentioned that they have noticed a greater number of Baltimore and Orchard Orioles in this locality this year than ever before. Speaking of the Orchard Oriole brings to mind that I noticed a, to me, very original nesting site for this species. While in a thicket on the Missouri collecting last summer, I found several nests of this Oriole in the willows, sometimes right amongst a colony of Red-winged Blackbirds. This place was at least a mile from any habitation, which impressed me as I had always thought that this species was fond of civilization.</p>
         
         <p>The local Naturalists' Association will open their fall course of lectures in October with a lecture by Prof. Barbour of the Nebraska State University.</p>
