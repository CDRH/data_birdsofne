         <head>A Catalogue of Nebraska Birds Arranged According to the Check List of the American Ornithological Union.</head>
         
         <head>W. Edgar Taylor, State Normal, Peru, Nebraska.</head>
         
         <p>The only published notes on the birds of Nebraska we have been able to find are Baird's notes in "Birds of North America," and "Locust Feeding Birds," by Dr. Samuel Aughey. The first was published when this country was a thinly settled territory, and the notes, which were made previous to 1857, make but little mention of the numbers, migrations, and general habits of the birds.</p>
         
         <p>The second publication, published in (1877) was not intended to give much more than the natural food of the avi fauna; some species being mentioned which the author states were no found in the state, while many known to have existed in the state were not named.</p>
         
         <p>Knowing the facts as stated, the writer has made a provisional list of the birds of the state, in the hopes of encouraging others to assist in a more provisional list of the birds of our native birds. In making this list he has not confined his notes to observations made by himself, which observations have been comparatively meager, but by using every reliable source of information, both published and unpublished, has aimed rather to make a temporary list arranged and revised according to check list of the American Ornithological Union, as corrected by Robert Ridgway in his Manual of North American Birds, published in 1887.</p>
         
         <p>In publishing this list we cheerfully acknowledge assistance received from the authorities already named; also to the Normal Science Society, for use of their records and collection as made by Messrs. C.J. Pierson, George Coleman, and others, and to many of the students of the State Normal living in different portions of the state. Dr. L.E. Hicks kindly allowed us the privilege of examining the collection of birds in the museum of the State University, but owing to circumstances over which we had no control, we have not examined this collection as carefully as we would like. However, we will say that a more careful study of this collection would show as inhabiting the state several species given as probable in our list.</p>
         
         <p>The writer has observed the following classification:</p>
         
         <list type="simple">
            
            <item>1. Constant residents species, some portion of which remain with us through the year.</item>
            
            <item>2. Summer residents, greater or less numbers of which spend the summer in the state and breed.</item>
            
            <item>3. Winter residents, species which spend at least part of the winter with us.</item>
            
            <item>4. Migratory, those birds which pass and repass through the state in spring and autumn.</item>
            
            <item>5. Other species are mentioned as Wandering, Occasional Visitants, or as Stragglers.</item>
         
         </list>
         
         <p>The species and varieties are numbered consecutively, the numbers in parentheses [or brackets] referring to the check list of the American Ornithological Union, 1868.</p>
