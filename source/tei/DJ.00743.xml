         <head>Robins in the Snow.</head>
         
         <p>For some inexplicable reason - and all bird-reason is inexplicable to us - there have been more Robins and earlier this year than usual in this vicinity. As we have remarked, Robins are always with us, in sequestered jungle-spots of winter - but seldom have so many of them made their appearance in the residential and other open sections so early as this year.</p>
         
         <p>When Thursday of last week came along, with its surprising quantity of snow, it was a very common thing for the amateur ornithologist to hear some layman bemoaning the sad fate of the Robins in such dire circumstances.</p>
         
         <p>Prospect of Redbreast freezing was uppermost in laity's mind - and laity was very nobly tearful at the idea.</p>
         
         <p>But God apparently constructed his wonderful Robins to meet such exigencies.</p>
         
         <p>A Robin very seldom suffers seriously from the cold - he being much too tough a customer to bother about March weather - or the weather of any other month, for that matter. If he doesn't like it, he goes somewhere else. If he likes it - which he generally does - he ducks for the underbrush and lets nature take its course.</p>
         
         <p>During and after Thursday's snowstorm it was interesting to see the Robins in the residential and park districts making the best of a bad bargain.</p>
         
         <p>They were huddled cheerfully under rose bushes or other shrubbery, cheeping once in a while, and scratching around through the wet snow for their hidden grub, just like a parcel of hens. And in the wildwood they would be found mostly on the south exposures of grasses or weeds - like Cottontails, weathering it out.</p>
         
         <p>Dear Robin Redbreast - staunchest and huskiest and humanest of all that God has sent us from his Bird Heaven - we thank Him and you, too, that we need not bother over your welfare!</p>
