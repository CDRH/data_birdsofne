         <head>A Vigorous Blazing Away That Brought Down the Game.</head>
         
         <p>The members of the Omaha Sportsmen's Club, who were chosen to maintain its prestige in the annual club hunt, having polished up their guns so carefully, sallied out in all directions prior to Thursday, to bag all the birds possible that day for the grand count. This latter affair came off at 4 o'clock yesterday at Collins &amp; Petty's, the sportsmen flocking in from every direction, with any outfit from a game bag to a four-horse wagon. The outcome of the hunt was a highly respectable bringing down of birds. Several of the men chosen on the respective sides were unable to take the field, and therefore the sides were not balanced.
