         <head>A Jack in the Hole.</head>
         
         <p>This may start out like the sad story of a swift little stud game, but it isn't. The jack referred to is neither the slang for dough, nor the ox-eyed gent of the paper jack. It is merely a Wilson Snipe.</p>
         
         <p>There is not a hunter in this part of the country that doesn't love the Wilson Snipe, which he invariably terms "Jack," and the elusive shore-bird with its swift and erratic flight makes the seasonable sport of shooting it - or at it - one of the fall treats.</p>
         
         <p>But it is remarkable that several instances should be recorded of the jack-snipe staying in these parts so late in the year, and especially after the large chunks of winter that have been hurled at us during the past two weeks.</p>
         
         <p>But at least two jacks have remained, and are patronizing open water-holes on the Little Pappio creek in the west part of Omaha. Possibly by this time the rabbit-hunters have run across them and caused their frigid demise - but otherwise we presume they are still fussing about the muddy opening made by live springs along this rivulet, eking out a somewhat sparse existence from the livestock to be secured there.</p>
         
         <p>The presence of Wilson Snipe in this region at this time, and that of Robins and Towhees in the jungles along the river bottoms, is sufficient proof that the birds love us, and would like to stay here the year 'round, if J. Pluvius would only be reasonable.</p>
         
         <p>Bluebirds have been seen in Riverview park in January.</p>
         
         <p>Good evening!</p>
