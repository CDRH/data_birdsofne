         <p>Columbus, Nebraska, December 5.—Game is reported as being very plentiful along the Platte River Valley, and judging by the number of quail and jack rabbits I have seen hanging up for sale in all the towns from Kearney east, I think it true. Hunters, however, report birds of all kinds as being very wild. An acquaintance brought in the other day as the results of one day's shooting, 23 quail, 1 chicken, 2 jack rabbits and 4 cotton tails—pretty fair bag for one gun, wasn't it? Geese are very scarce on the river and flying wild.</p>
