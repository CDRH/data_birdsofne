         <head>A Tufted Treat.</head>
         
         <p>There have been surgeons who have thrown ecstatic fits of rapture upon securing a patient with some rare disease, even if said disease be most likely fatal. Such scientific convulsions come to your bird fan when he finds a feather specimen or which he had been looking anon.</p>
         
         <p>It has been known that the Tufted Titmouse is more than occasionally found in Nebraska; that he is common - in the books - but when an amateur ornithologist actually meets such a critter face to face, he is likely to experience the same thrill as that of the surgeon mentioned before.</p>
         
         <p>But little larger than a Chickadee and of a good deal the same appearance except that he wears a distinct topknot, the Tufted Titmouse is worth the effort of finding him.</p>
         
         <p>He flutters around in the tree-tops or bush-tops like his more common cousin, and his most familiar call is "Pe-to! Pe-to!"</p>
         
         <p>The Tufted Titmouse appeared in Elmwood park last Sunday for the first time in the recorded history of Omaha bird-dom, and it is more than possible that he remains there, for there is no reason why he should leave.</p>
         
         <p>It is such pleasant surprises that makes the game of bird hunting worth the trouble.</p>
         
         <p>The Myrtle Warblers, with their glistening yellow rump, appeared in this park on the same Sunday - a bit ahead of schedule - and it is very plain that the treasures of the feathered world are soon to be revealed in the entirety that always graces gentle Springtime.</p>
         
         <p>See if you can find the Tufted Titmouse. It will be a treat.</p>
