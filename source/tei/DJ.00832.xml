         <head>Counting the Game Yesterday - Major Thornburgh's Side the Victors.</head>
         
         <p>the spring hunt of the Omaha Sportsmen's Club came off on Thursday, and the game was counted yesterday at Collins &amp; Petty's sportsmen's depot, corner of Douglas and Fourteenth streets. A crowd of the sportsmen and their friends were present to witness the counting and examine the game. The latter was on the whole in fine condition, and made a grand display when laid out for examination. The ground hunted over was about the same as last fall, nearly all the members of the club having their favorite hunting grounds, which they visit at each hunt. The scores of each contestant were as follows.</p>

         <p>As the hunt was "man against man," it will be seen by the above score that Thornburgh's side were the victors, both in total score, and by the 6 to 3 on individual record. Petty, whose count was the best, more than doubled his score of last fall, and Sutphen, whose score was the lowest, was also at the foot of the record last year, when he had 0.</p>
         
         <p>The total score of last fall's hunt was 581, just 220 below that of this hunt, while the number participating this spring was but 14, against 16 last fall. The average score last fall was 36 5-16; this spring it is 57 3-14. Ten of the sportsmen taking part in Wednesday's hunt participated also in that of last fall.</p>
