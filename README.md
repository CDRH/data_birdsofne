## About the Project

The Birds of Nebraska is an archive of history for birdlife in the state, with access to a great variety of newspaper articles and other sources from 1854 to 1923.

The articles were collected by James E. Ducey, who generously donated the files to the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln Libraries. They are being presented with the aid of the UNL Libraries.
